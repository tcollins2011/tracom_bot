        "question": "Can Style predict success at work?",
        "answer": "Style itself does not predict success. Instead, TRACOM's research shows that a person’s Versatility predicts performance and success. All SOCIAL STYLEs - Driving, Expressive, Amiable, and Analytical - exist across all industries and occupations, and the success of individuals depends on their Versatility. Thus, it is a person's ability to effectively adapt and communicate with others, leveraging their interpersonal skills, that leads to success."

        "question": "Is it better to be Tell Assertive at work? Are Tell Assertive people more successful? Are Tell Assertive people better leaders?",
        "answer": "Tell Assertive people tend to make their opinions known, are seen as active and often take charge in situations. On the surface, these qualities could be associated with leadership and might contribute to success in roles that require decisiveness and direct communication. However, success depends significantly on the context, including the nature of the work, the organizational culture, and the expectations of the role. Conversely, Ask Assertive people are cooperative, good listeners, and supportive of others' ideas, which are also valuable leadership traits, especially in roles requiring teamwork, collaboration, and careful consensus-building. Versatility, or the ability to adapt one's behavior to suit the demands of different situations and interact effectively with different people, is a critical component of performing successfully. So, whether being Tell Assertive is advantageous would depend on the situation and the need to balance assertiveness with other requirements. Being Tell Assertive might offer advantages in certain scenarios where directness and decisiveness are valued, but it is the flexibility to adapt one's assertiveness level—increasing or decreasing it as the situation demands—that is more closely related to leadership effectiveness."

        "question": "What is the difference between Style and personality?",
        "answer": "The main distinction between personality and Style lies in the visibility and observable nature of Style, which includes actions and behaviors that others can see and respond to, whereas personality encompasses a deeper, more intrinsic combination of characteristics and motivations that influence an individual's behaviors and actions. Personality is a combination of characteristics that uniquely influence a person's thoughts, motivations, and behaviors. It is derived from the interplay of thoughts, beliefs, motivations, values, and actions and lies beneath the surface, much like the part of an iceberg that is underwater. SOCIAL STYLE® is observable behaviors that are a part of one's overall personality but are the aspects that others can see and interact with. This includes what a person says and does, and how they say and do it, encompassing both verbal and nonverbal communication. Style is evident through various observable actions and tendencies, such as pacing in speech, volume, facial expressions, and body language."

        "question": "Are there generational differences in Style? Does gen z have different Style proportions than other generations? Do younger people have lower Versatility than older people?",
        "answer": "TRACOM’s research shows that there are no meaningful differences in Style across age groups. This means there are just as many people in each Style category for younger adults as for older adults. Likewise, there are no differences in Versatility across age categories. Remember that Versatility is the ability to adjust one's behavior in a way that is skilled across different situations, and it is not fixed; it can be learned and improved with conscious effort and practice. Therefore, it does not depend on the age of an individual but rather on their awareness of SOCIAL STYLE® preferences and their focus on meeting others' needs."

        "question": "Does Style change over time? Can our Style change as we get older?",
        "answer": "SOCIAL STYLE® behaviors are formed during our formative years and by adulthood become fairly consistent. However, Style can change across time. TRACOM’s research shows that Style is less stable for people age 30 and under than for older adults. This means that as people enter the workforce they are learning and adjusting over time, which can affect their behavior and how others view them. Therefore, their Style may change modestly over time. This corroborates research on personality that shows personality can change subtly over time. Personality is less stable for younger people than for older adults. Since Style behavior is influenced by personality, it makes sense that both show an ability to change slightly over time."

        "question": "Can my Style be different at home than at work?",
        "answer": "Sometimes, the way individuals exhibit their SOCIAL STYLE® can be different at home compared to work, but this difference is not a matter of a different SOCIAL STYLE. Instead, it's about the degree of Versatility one shows. In professional settings, people tend to manage their behavior more carefully to maintain work relationships. At home, individuals might feel safer to express their frustrations or exhibit their backup behaviors, which are nonproductive behaviors we sometimes use when stressed. This difference in behavior reflects the Versatility individuals exercise in different environments rather than a change in their inherent SOCIAL STYLE."

        "question": "Do any of the Styles have higher Versatility than the others?",
        "answer": "No. TRACOM’s research shows that every Style shows a range of Versatility, from low to high. No Style has consistently higher or lower Versatility than any other Style."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do Amiable Style people have higher Versatility than other Styles?",
        "answer": "TRACOM’s research shows that no Style shows more Versatility than any other. Amiable Style individuals can exhibit both high and low levels of Versatility depending on their behaviors and approaches to situations. When they behave with high Versatility, Amiable Style people are very skilled at getting people to work together in a productive way, creating a calm and friendly environment while remaining industrious. They're adept at networking, building relationships, and mediating conflicts, which benefits not only them but also those around them. Their focus on relationships, coupled with their optimistic outlook and use of feedback skills, contributes to creating a friendly and productive work environment. However, Amiable Style individuals may also show low Versatility, particularly when they demonstrate inflexibility to change, especially if they're not involved in decision-making. This resistance to change can lead to feelings of resentment. They may also have difficulties maintaining trust when pushing the boundaries of established limits or in making tough decisions. Thus, whether Amiable Style people have higher Versatility depends on their specific behavior patterns in various situations, including their ability to adapt and assert themselves when necessary."

        "question": "How often do people see their own Style differently from how their co-workers or others see them?",
        "answer": "TRACOM’s research shows that people’s self-perception of their Style is different from their co-workers’ perceptions about 50% of the time. Thus, approximately one-half of people evaluate their Style as being different from how their co-workers evaluate them. This is likely due to the well-researched self-assessment bias, which affects how people see themselves in relation to how others see them. Part of the value of SOCIAL STYLE is getting feedback on your behavior as others see you."

      {
        "question": "How often do people see their Versatility differently from how their co-workers or others see them?",
        "answer": "TRACOM’s research shows self-perception of Versatility is different from others for about two-thirds of people. This is somewhat higher than self-awareness of Style, where about one-half of people see their Style differently. This is likely due to the well-researched self-assessment bias, which affects how people see themselves in relation to how others see them. Regarding Versatility it is common for people to see themselves acting with higher Versatility than others see them."

        "question": "Are there sex/gender differences on Style or Versatility?",
        "answer": "TRACOM’s most recent research shows that there are no meaningful differences between males and females on Assertiveness or Responsiveness – the behaviors that make up Style – or on Versatility. Average scores on these constructs are essentially equal across the sexes."

      {
        "question": "Are there differences across cultures (or countries) in Social Style or Versatility?",
        "answer": "TRACOM develops norms for countries and regions across the world. These norms account for any differences in average Style and Versatility. This means that people can receive the most accurate possible profile results that are specific to their country. Research shows that the average differences across countries are small. For instance, while China is more Tell Assertive than the U.S., the difference is relatively small."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there any differences across ethnicities or race on Style or Versatility?",
        "answer": "TRACOM regularly analyzes for differences across ethnicities within the U.S. and has not found any meaningful differences on average Style or Versatility positions. This means that across races and ethnicities, average positions on Style and Versatility are essentially the same."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I be Ask Assertive sometimes and Tell Assertive other times?",
        "answer": "Yes, it is perfectly normal to show a range of behavior across the Assertiveness and Responsiveness continuums. In some situations, you might be more asking and in other situations more telling. However, everyone has a comfort zone where their behavior is most common. If we took a sample of your behavior, most frequently you would behave in a specific place on the Assertiveness and Responsiveness continuums. This average behavior represents your SOCIAL STYLE."

      {
        "question": "Is SOCIAL STYLE valid? Is Style meaningful? Does Style measure anything that matters? Is Style a real personality model?",
        "answer": "The accuracy of the SOCIAL STYLE model has been tested over many decades and is a valid and reliable measure of behavioral style. The profile was developed to meet the 'Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing' as outlined by the American Psychological Association (APA) and other professional organizations. These standards ensure that psychological assessments are valid and reliable. This research is documented in a technical report available for download at tracom.com. The model shows effectiveness in both professional and personal settings, impacting individual behavior, leadership development, team cooperation, and interpersonal relationships. For instance, Sigma Chi, an international fraternity, leveraged SOCIAL STYLEs to significantly enhance the leadership skills of its members, with 85% of participants reporting that SOCIAL STYLEs positively changed their lives and boosted their leadership abilities post-graduation. Similarly, a study at a leading graduate business school found that curriculum on human behavior using SOCIAL STYLEs offered graduates a distinct advantage in their careers by enabling them to work effectively with others of similar and dissimilar Styles, fostering greater trust and cooperation within teams. Overall, the evidence and applications of SOCIAL STYLE indicate its validity as a practical tool for enhancing interpersonal effectiveness, leadership abilities, and personal relationships."
